## Project Overview
This project analyzes supply chain logistics performance, focusing on delivery efficiency, shipment timing, and cost variability across vendors and routes.

The purpose of this analysis is to uncover operational insights and support data-driven decision making, while demonstrating analytical and programming skills in R for academic and professional development.

## Key Steps in Analysis
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Summary statistics and distribution analysis
- Visualization of shipping time, cost, and vendor performance
- Relationship analysis between distance and delivery metrics

## How to Run This Project
1. Open this project in RStudio.
2. Ensure the dataset is in the `data/` folder.
3. Knit the `Grant_Joshua_Supply_Chain_Analysis.Rmd` file to generate output.

## Output
The final report is located in the `outputs/` folder as an `.html` file.
